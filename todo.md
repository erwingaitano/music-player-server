- dismiss songs modal

# TODO
- current playlist modal
- download music to local
- add cover
- remote player controls
  - fix remote slider
  - fix next song not playing automatically in background. (Posible solution is to use AVQueuePlayer)
- shuffle and repeat music should be outside the player

# NOTES
- the player should only concern about playing the playlist, showing the song ifno
  and no more  (no shuffle functionality, add music to playlist, etc)

- gonna rely on a local server to serve the music files since i can't find a free good
  solution for cloud storage for static files

# DONE
- show the name of the song in the player
